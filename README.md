<details>
  <summary><a name="concept_confirmation_tag">Confirmation tag</a></summary>
  
  A MAC over the [confirmed transcript hash](#concept_confirmed_transcript_hash) (calculated by using the `confirmation_key`).
  It confirms that the members of the group have arrived at the same state of the group, because the confirmed transcript hash covers every commit and (although indirectly) every proposal.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><a name="concept_confirmed_transcript_hash">Confirmed transcript hash</a></summary>
  
  A running (chained) hash over the whole history of `Commit` messages including the most recent `Commit`. 
  `Proposal`s are indirectly included through the `ProposalRef`s in the `Commit` that applied them.
  The hash of a `Commit` (and a `Proposal` to obtain a `ProposalRef`) is calculated over the `MLSAuthenticatedContent` in which it was sent.

## E

<details>
  <summary><a name="concept_external_commit">External commit</a></summary>
  
  A mechanism for new members (external parties that want to become members of the group) to add themselves to a group, without requiring that an existing member has to come online to issue a Commit that references an Add Proposal. New members can create an External Commit if they have access to the current group info (that contains an ExternalPub extension). External Commits work like regular Commits, however, their content has to meet a specific set of requirements.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><a name="proposal_external_init">ExternalInit (Proposal)</a></summary>
  
  A proposal used by new members to join a group by using an [external commit](#concept_external_commit). This proposal can only be used in that context.
